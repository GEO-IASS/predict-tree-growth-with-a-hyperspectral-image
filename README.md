T. Trevor Caughlin is the author of the R code. This code uses the PRESS statistic to select narrowband indices, the normalized difference between two narrowbands from hyperspectral data, to predict tree growth rates. The concept is not limited to tree growth rates and could be used for any continuous metric that needs to be predicted from a hyperspectral image.
